Project Overview
The Flu Trends Visualization project aims to provide an interactive dashboard for analyzing
U.S. flu trends by state, strain, and time. Using the CDC FluView API as the primary data
source, this project will help public health officials, travelers, and the general public understand
flu patterns, identify high-risk areas, and monitor flu strain distributions.
● Data Source: CDC FluView API
(https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html)
● Visualization Type: Healthcare data dashboard with heat maps, line charts, and strain
distribution charts.
Project Structure and Team Roles

Project Tools and Technologies
● Libraries: Plotly, Pandas, Flask, SQLAlchemy
● Platform: Deployed on Heroku
● Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for scalable data management
Design Plan
● Dashboard Layout: Multiple visualization panels with filtering and export options.
● User Interactivity: Real-time filtering, tooltips, and CSV data export.
● Color Scheme: Health-friendly colors with high contrast for readability.
Project Timeline (Revised for December 3 Deadline)
● Data Collection and Cleaning: By November 18, 2024
● Design and Development: By November 25, 2024
● Testing and Final Adjustments: By December 1, 2024
● Deployment and Documentation: By December 3, 2024
Potential Challenges
● Data Limitations: Managing API limitations and data quality issues.
● Group Coordination: Effective communication through weekly meetings and Kanban
board tracking.
Expected Outcomes
The project aims to deliver a user-friendly, data-driven dashboard for real-time flu trend analysis
across the U.S. This tool will support public health safety by enabling informed decisions about
flu risks and trends.
Feedback and Revision Plan
Regular feedback will be gathered from peers, with improvements based on testing and user 
experience trials.
